<p><i>AI and Robotics Ventures, Thailand</i>, 2022.04 - 2024.08 </p>
        
My main responsibility was to develop **autonomous drone system** for inspection and surveillance across multiple industries, with primary focus on oil and gas operations. The project comprised of UAV charging stations and autonomous drones with the focus on **human-robot collaboration** for security applications and high-risk operations in offshore environments, applying **deep learning** to UAV's visual sensing to detect infrastructure defects. I also designed **constraint-based coverage path-planning algorithms** optimized for automated aerial photogrammetry, enabling systematic data collection to support routine inspections in disaster management.

<!-- - Engineered robust middleware using **MAVLink protocol** with **asynchronous programming**, enabling real-time integration between **high-level planning algorithms** and **PX4 flight control systems**.
- Built comprehensive **perception pipelines** combining **real-time vehicle detection** , [traffic analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=vWj5LBRe6RA&ab_channel=AIANDROBOTICSVENTURES) for government-funded infrastructure projects (£7K), and **photogrammetric reconstruction** for disaster management.
- Designed **constraint-based coverage path-planning algorithms** optimized for automated aerial photogrammetry.
- Developed **teleoperation frameworks** and **fleet coordination systems** enabling seamless human-robot collaboration. Architected **distributed control systems** supporting multiple autonomous UAVs, multiple autonomous robots, and IoT devices. -->

Research Assistant
------
<p><b>Modular Temperature-Controlled Syringe Pump Extruder for Soft Material 3D Printer</b> <br> <i>Department of Mechanical Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Thailand</i>, 2021.05 - 2021.10 </p>

I led the development of a **syringe-based 3D bioprinter** after my graduation from undergraduate studies. This 3D bioprinter was capable of printing **high-temperature viscoelastic materials**. This **self-initiated research project** transformed academic work into a functional prototype. The core challenge lay in the complex behavior of viscoelastic materials, which exhibit both elastic and viscous properties that confound traditional pressure-based extrusion systems. I also extended **open-source 3D printer firmware** to develop a **human-language interface** that converts simple text commands (e.g., typing "A" to print the letter A) directly into 3D printer trajectories, eliminating the need for traditional G-code or 3D models. This **feature-based trajectory generator** accounted for material lag times and non-linear flow responses, and enabled **computer vision integration** where the system could automatically detect shapes on the printing bed and generate corresponding print commands for **adaptive printing**.

<!-- I transformed the 3D bioprinting paper into this 3D bioprinter project after my graduation from undergraduate studies. This project didn't contribute on my grade, but it came from my own passion in bridging the gap between research academic and industry. This project focus on developing a syringe-based 3D printer for viscoelastic material. The challenges lie in the inherent combination of elastic and viscous properties that makes the pressurised-bioprinter can not printed this type of materials. 

- Transformed a cartesian robot into the syringe-based soft material 3D printer, which is capable of controlling
the temperature of the syringe and printing bed, helping secure £67K funding from the National Research
Council of Thailand (NRCT)
- Designed PCBs for soft material printing benefits, including an extruder, printing bed, and nozzle calibration
module.
- Extended open-source 3D printer firmware to create custom control interfaces and generate feature-based
trajectories, leading to the prototype showcase at Thailand Inventor’s Day -->
