<a id="project"></a>

Hello, and welcome! I am a recent graduate with a Master's degree in Robotics from [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk) and [University of the West of England](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/). During my studies, I worked at [Aerial Robotics Group](https://aerialroboticsgroup.github.io/) and [Bristol Robotics Laboratory](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com/), under the supervision of [Dr. Bahadir Kocer](](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/)) and co-supervision of [Dr. Rui Wu](linkedin.com/in/wurui1991)

My research focuses on mechanical design, modeling, control, and motion planning of aerial physical interaction with applications in aerial manipulation and navigation. My goal is to make aerial robotics go beyond being just *flying eyes* into fully functional *flying hands*


> **I am currently seeking a PhD position**

Past Projects
======

I have done numerous mechatronics projects during my undergraduate studies. I have worked with STM32, Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi with many sensors and actuators. I'm into low-level control and embedded machine learning algorithms on edge computing platforms. Also, I love 3D printing technology.
